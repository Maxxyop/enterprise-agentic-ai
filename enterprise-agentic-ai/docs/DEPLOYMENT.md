# Deployment Instructions for Enterprise Agentic AI

## Prerequisites
Before deploying the Enterprise Agentic AI project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Redis (for caching LLM prompts)
- A compatible database (SQLite or any other as per your configuration)

## Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enterprise-agentic-ai.git
   cd enterprise-agentic-ai
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python packages. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements/base.txt
   pip install -r requirements/ai.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.template` provided in the root directory. Update the values as necessary for your environment.

4. **Database Setup**
   If using SQLite, ensure that the database file is created as specified in `config/backend/database.py`. For other databases, follow the respective setup instructions.

5. **Docker Setup**
   Build the Docker images using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.agentic.yml up --build
   ```

6. **Run Migrations (if applicable)**
   If your project requires database migrations, run the migration scripts as defined in your database setup.

7. **Start the Application**
   After building the Docker images, start the application:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.agentic.yml up
   ```

8. **Access the Application**
   Once the application is running, you can access it via the specified port in your Docker configuration (default is usually `http://localhost:8000`).

## Testing the Deployment
After deployment, run the integration tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly:
```
pytest tests/integration/
```

## Troubleshooting
- Check the logs for any errors during startup. Logs can be accessed via Docker:
  ```
  docker-compose logs
  ```
- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- Verify that all dependencies are installed and compatible with your Python version.

## Additional Notes
- For production deployments, consider using a more robust database and configuring Redis for caching.
- Regularly update your dependencies and monitor for security vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
Following these steps will help you successfully deploy the Enterprise Agentic AI project. For further assistance, refer to the README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md files in the `docs` directory.
