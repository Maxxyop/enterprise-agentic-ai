# README for Enterprise Agentic AI

## Overview

Enterprise Agentic AI is a comprehensive framework designed for automated penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. This project integrates advanced AI models to orchestrate tasks, analyze vulnerabilities, and generate actionable insights for security professionals.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **Orchestrator**: Manages the overall workflow and task orchestration.
- **AI Agents**: Implements various AI models for reasoning, command execution, and vulnerability classification.
- **Knowledge Base**: Stores and retrieves vulnerability data and engagement models.
- **Execution Engine**: Executes security tools and manages their outputs.
- **Observation System**: Monitors applications and analyzes outputs for feedback.
- **Training Pipeline**: Collects data and fine-tunes models for improved performance.
- **Backend**: Provides API services and manages database interactions.
- **Frontend**: User interface for interacting with the system.
- **Config**: Configuration files for various components.
- **Docs**: Documentation for users and developers.

## Features

- **Task Orchestration**: Implements the OODA loop for efficient task management.
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: Utilizes DeepSeek R1 and Qwen-7B for advanced reasoning and command execution.
- **Dynamic Tooling**: Generates and validates scripts for various security tools.
- **Feedback Loops**: Adapts strategies based on real-time feedback from monitoring systems.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Provides localization for different languages, including Hindi.
